Implemented a machine learning project titled "Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Using Linear Regression in Python" where I utilized data science techniques to develop and deploy a Linear Regression model for estimating   medical insurance costs. 
Through comprehensive data preprocessing, including feature engineering and exploratory data analysis, successfully established a predictive relationship between variables such as age, BMI, smoker status, region, and number of children.
By training, validating, and optimizing the model, I achieved accurate predictions and communicated the findings using data visualization techniques. 
This project showcased my proficiency in Python, machine learning, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and effective communication of results.
